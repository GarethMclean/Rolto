### 2. Upload your content

Add your documentation and knowledge base:

2. Upload your PDFs, documentation, FAQs, or knowledge base
3. Rolto will automatically learn from your content

### 3. Add the widget to your website

Copy and paste this single line of code into your website's HTML, just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://app.rolto.io/widget.js"></script>
```

### 4. Customize your widget (optional)

You can customize the appearance and behavior of your widget:

```html
<script>
  window.RoltoConfig = {
    position: 'bottom-right', // or 'bottom-left'
    theme: 'light', // or 'dark'
    welcomeMessage: 'Hi! How can I help you today?'
  };
</script>
<script src="https://app.rolto.io/widget.js"></script>
```

### 5. Test your installation

1. Visit your website
2. Look for the Rolto chat widget in the bottom corner
3. Try asking a question to test the AI responses

<Callout type="info" twClass="mt-4">
  The widget will automatically appear on all pages where you've added the script. 
  Make sure to add it to every page where you want customer support available.
</Callout>
